                <p>Hi! My name is Cristian. I'm from Brazil. I love programming, sports, music, being with my family, going to church and playing games!
                    I've been working as a software developer for almost five years.
                    I already worked with: html, css, javascript, java, python, scala, lua and R.
                    In my experience, I had to do many challenging tasks, such as being flexible while working
                    not only with different programming languages, but also several frameworks for them.
                    Being a developer is my passion. I love to solve real life problems with software solutions!
                </p>
